# Resources

### jQuery Plugins

- [Morphext](http://morphext.fyianlai.com/)
	- I used this plugin to rotate a series of set texts within the "Happy Hour Specials" string. 

- [Unslider](http://unslider.com/)
	- This plugin is a jQuery slider for images. I used this to highlight restaurant images for the Upcoming Event section.

### Custom jQuery

- I did not use any resources outside of the lectures and my notes on this code.

### Custom JavaScript

- [MouseOver](https://www.sitepoint.com/web-foundations/onmouseover-html-element/) and [MouseOut](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/mouseout)
	- I referred to the resources above to assit writing the code. 


# Deductions
- I reviewed the list of deductions for this project and in the syllabus.

# Comments

### Custom jQuery

- This custom jQuery code changes and elements content when the button below is clicked. 

### Custom JavaScript

- This custom JS code allows the image to change once the mouse goes over the image. When the user moves out of the changed image, it reverts back to the original image. It took some trial and error since images were involved (and since I haven't used this events before), but it works! It just takes a few seconds to work after the page loads.
